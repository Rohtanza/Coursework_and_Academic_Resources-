I am giving you two py files, these models are implemented through Eular method. now implement the RK-2 and RK-4 method for the sharkCompetition.py and PredatorPrey.py models by changing the code in predatorPrey.py and sharkCompetition.py. As i told you those files have code for implementation of Euler method. First call the RK-2 implementation and then RK-4 implementation. The Code should also measure the time taken to execute both methods and compare them with the time taken by Euler method, RK-2 and RK-4 Method.

give me code in chuck, 3 chunks, first generate first half, then second half and then third one, and ask me after every chuck that should you continue

So the code will be a driver program, first call euler method, and calulate time and then do this for Rk-2 and RK-4
these things will be three functions.

Convert the variable names into the snake case. and write the code humanize way

Write the logic of rk2 and rk4 as per these algorithums, i need time to exucation of the which method, i want to compare which method take how much time, like eular and the rk2 and rk4 each time, and plot the graph for each method simulation

just give me the code, cut the explanation
