\begin{abstract}
This assignment has enhancements made to the Hospital Management System (HMS) in Stage 4, focusing on the implementation of SOLID design principles to improve the systemâ€™s design and architecture. This assignment addresses improvements in modularity, maintainability, and scalability by refining class structures and interactions within the system. Detailed explanations of the adjustments in class diagrams and sequence diagrams illustrate the practical application of these principles.

\section*{Introduction}
In the previous assignment of HMS, the initial design and sequence diagrams were developed, capturing basic functionalities and interactions. Assignment 4 advances this design by applying SOLID principles, which are fundamental to creating a more robust, maintainable, and flexible object-oriented system. These principles guide the restructuring and enhancement of the system architecture.

\section*{Application of SOLID Principles}
\subsection*{Overview of SOLID Principles}
SOLID principles, which I've used in this assignment, consist of five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)}: A class should have only one reason to change.
    \item \textbf{Open/Closed Principle (OCP)}: Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
    \item \textbf{Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)}: Objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the application.
    \item \textbf{Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)}: Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
    \item \textbf{Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)}: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Enhanced Class Diagram}
The enhanced class diagram, shown below, illustrates the refined structure and relationships, emphasizing adherence to SOLID principles.
